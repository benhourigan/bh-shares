# Make a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub: Join](http://github.com/join) and make an account.

Email me your username at [ben@hourigan.co](mailto:ben@hourigan.co) so I can invite you to join the repository for your project.

# Editing on GitHub

You can actually view and edit files directly in your repository on GitHub.

Be careful: there is no auto-save here.

When you are done, enter a descriptive commit message, like "Deleted repetitive paragraphs from Chapter 5", and commit to save your changes.

If you want to keep things simple, you can stop here. The rest of the instructions cover what you will need if you want to work on the project using desktop applications, and to keep a copy saved to your own computer. This is a much more powerful way to work with the project, but is more technical and requires installing additional software.

# Installing the Atom Text editor

## Mac

There's a prominent download link for Mac users at the top of the [Atom homepage](https://atom.io/).

## Windows

Install latest Windows release here. [Click here to download latest version as of 14 May 2015.]()

You may find a newer release here: https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest. The file you want is called `AtomSetup.exe`

# Use the GitHub desktop application

## Installation

Mac: https://mac.github.com/  
Windows: https://windows.github.com/

Download and install.

## Clone the repository

Go to your repository on the GitHub site and click the "Clone in desktop" button if you want to begin working on your computer. You will need to choose a directory to save it to. I recommend creating a specific folder for each project inside another folder called GitHub, e.g. `/GitHub/my-project`.

## Always sync before you start work

When working on the desktop, you must pull down any recent changes from the repository before you start. Otherwise, you could end up with conflicts, if anyone else has been working on the same file. Plus, you always want the most recent version to work on.
